# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Visualization

A Vue.js project that visualizes the Bellman-Ford algorithm using Vis.js for graph visualization.

## Description

This project showcases the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is used to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
The algorithm is visually demonstrated using Vis.js library for graph visualization.

## Features

- Visualization of the Bellman-Ford algorithm steps on a graph.
- Interactive graph creation and editing.
- Clear representation of shortest paths and relaxation steps.
